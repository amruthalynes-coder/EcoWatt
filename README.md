### Hosted Project Link
[mention your project hosted link here]

### Project Description
[Smart Campus Energy Monitoring & AI Prediction System is a web-based dashboard that monitors energy consumption across multiple rooms in a campus environment.]

### The Problem statement
[Educational institutions and office campuses consume a significant amount of electrical energy daily]

### The Solution
[We propose a Smart Campus Energy Monitoring & AI Prediction System that:
1. Monitors Energy Room-wise
Each room has a separate dashboard with independent tracking.
2. Provides Real-Time Visualization
Energy usage is displayed using dynamic graphs for better understanding.
 3. AI-Based Consumption Prediction
The system uses moving average time-series logic to predict next hour energy usage.
4. Carbon Emission Calculation
Energy consumption is converted into carbon footprint using standard emission factor.
 5. Role-Based Access
Admin → Full control
User → View-only access
6. Efficiency Leaderboard
Rooms are ranked based on energy efficiency to promote healthy competition.?]
